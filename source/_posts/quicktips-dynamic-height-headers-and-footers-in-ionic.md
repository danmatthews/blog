Hi Guys!

So i thought to celebrate the launch of the blog i'd do a quick screencast sharing a tip that i've discovered just this afternoon.

It's really handy if you want to have static sections in the header and/or footer of your Ionic app but want to keep the main content scrollable.

Especially if you're hiding or showing things dynamically based on something like the response from an API request.

Keep an eye out as i'll be releasing more of these snippets ahead of launching my new Ionic video course later this year!
