As a developer that works in numerous ways - from a standard client/freelancer relationship, to subcontracting through other freelancers, and working with clients who are very protective of their ideas. I find it hard to find clear ways to shout about the work i've been able to do.

A **lot** of my work comes via referral - either from people i know personally, or people i've worked for previously. Often, in the inital emails, i get this:

> Hi Dan, {x} has recommended you, do you have any previous work you could show us?

And that is **100% a completely fine question** and to be expected, you wouldn't want to hire anyone without having seen something they've done (or multiple things they've done). But my problem is that:

1. Even though i've done plenty of work, usually, they're much smaller parts of larger projects, through another agency or client that I may/may not have signed a confidentiality agreement with.
2. Sometimes, clients will lock down my ability to ever shout about certain projects through an NDA/Contract to prevent competitors nicking their ideas.
3. In the case of partial work done for other clients, I feel i can't advertise the work itself, as I wouldn't want anyone to think i'm taking credit for the *whole* project.
4. Some of the best projects i've worked on are part of previous jobs, and i'm not sure how I go about showing those off without being unethical, as well as having to be very specific that this was something that was done as part of a previous *team*.

So it's a tricky one. I'd love to know how other companies handle it, if you have ideas or examples, send them across to [@danmatthews](http://danmatthews.me) on twitter.
